Who doesn't love soft pretzels? Fortunately, they're straightforward if involved, and pretty fun to make on your own! I followed [this recipe](https://www.browneyedbaker.com/soft-pretzels/), only omitting the egg wash at the end as I found it was tedious and didn't decrease my pretzel enjoyment.

You'll want to be prepared for the multi-step process on these fellas:
1. mixing the dough
2. initial bulk rise
3. heating the baking soda bath
4. shaping the pretzels
5. dip the pretzels in the baking soda bath
6. sprinkle salt and bake!

They're well worth the effort! Soft, tender and salty, they go great with nacho cheese. If you sprinkle decorative sugar or sprinkles instead of salt, you can eat them with icing for a sweet twist!
