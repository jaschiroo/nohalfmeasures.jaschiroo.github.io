For the tea:

- 4 tea bags (I used Twinings decaf Chai)
- 1.5 liters boiling water
- .5 liters cold water

Directions
1. in a container that can hold 1/2 gallon or 2 liters, steep the tea bags in the boiling water for at least 10 minutes (If you end up forgetting it, I've learned that it will be fine)
2. Remove the tea bags and add the cold water
3. Chill

For the boba:
Ingredients
- 6 cups water
- 1/3 cup "quick cooking" boba per person
- 1/4 c sweetened condensed milk per person
- 8 oz chilled chai tea

Directions
1. Bring water to a boil in a pot
2. Add boba, reduce heat to medium low and cover
3. Simmer for at least 15 minutes, ideally for 1 hour
4. Strain and run cold water over boba
5. Put boba in a 16 oz glass and add sweetened condensed milk. Let sit for any amount of time, ideally 1 hour
6. Add chilled chai, stir to combine
7. Enjoy with a spoon or boba straw!

Notes: for taro boba, add 3 Tbsp taro powder. See [taro boba adventure](/adventures/2020/03/11/taro-boba.html)!
