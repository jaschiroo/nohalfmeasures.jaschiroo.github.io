My name is Justina Schiroo. I’m interested in the challenges of working collaboratively with stakeholders, developers and UX while keeping the end user as the main focus of the work. I have particular passion for understanding user needs, project management and the process of iteratively designing for the people who will actually use what I help to create. I graduated from the University of Minnesota with a degree in Human Factors & Ergonomics.
