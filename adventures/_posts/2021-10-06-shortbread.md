I have a friend who likes shortbread, and so as a gift I decided to make many flavors! As a connoisseur, I'm sure that plain is probably the best, but that's not how I roll. I followed [this shortbread recipe](https://preppykitchen.com/shortbread-cookies-recipe/#recipe), and found out later that [this BBC recipe](https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/shortbread_1290) is probably better, but oh well.

I decided to make three batches of the dough and divide them in half to get six flavors: cranberry orange, cinnamon, chocolate, matcha, ginger, and plain.

For each flavor, here is the addition I made:
- Cranberry orange: 1/4 c. chopped cranberries and 1/4 c. chopped candied orange peel
- Cinnamon: 1/4 c. finely chopped nuts and 1 tsp cinnamon
- Chocolate: 1/4 c. chopped dark chocolate
- Matcha: 1/4 c. chopped white chocolate and 1 Tbsp matcha powder
- Ginger: 1/4 c. chopped crystallized ginger and 1 Tbsp ground ginger

The cranberry orange and ginger were pleasant additions, and the cinnamon was pretty good. I didn't particularly like the chocolate or matcha, although I think I'd need to add more matcha to really be able to taste it.
