Apparently 2021 was the year of ube, and I'm late to the party. Seriously, have you _seen_ this yam? Vibrantly purple, giving everything you use it in a lovely lavender-to-violet color. I learned that some of this is not due to the ube directly, but rather to the inclusion of ube extract, which I both embraced and also see as slightly cheating. Since I went to the trouble of making [ube halaya](https://wanderlustyle.com/ube-halaya/) from dried ube, I am determined to use it even if the recipe doesn't call for it!

The process of making ube halaya can be summed up as: stir. After rehydrating, you add the canned milks and just stir for about 45 minutes until it reaches the right consistency. My first goal was to make ube mochi, so I wanted it to be on the stiffer side for the filling.

Making halaya wasn't awful - but it is an arm workout! Luckily 4 oz of dried ube made slightly more than two pints of halaya, because I have big plans!

First off, [ube mochi](https://www.honestfoodtalks.com/ube-mochi/)! I recognize that I had no idea what I was doing, and also hadn't found any potato starch so I used more mochiko to help me roll out the mochi - which was rough. The mochi was still very sticky even after dusting, and it took two of us to get the filling inside.

The finished mochi looked a little rough on their own, but dressed up in some cupcake liners and allowed to settle into a smoother shape, they were slightly prettier! They tasted quite good, and had the right texture. I'll have to try again and spend a little more time on the shaping and presentation.

Next up was [mochi donuts](https://www.hungryhuy.com/mochi-donut-recipe/)! I didn't set out to make these, but managed to incorporate ube in the glaze - and they turned out wonderful! Slightly misshapen, but the texture and flavor was right on.

Most recently, I made [ube mochi waffles](https://keepingitrelle.com/ube-mochi-waffles-recipe/) for my post-baby shower brunch. Not only did I want to incorporate my ube halaya into another recipe, but also I was looking for an interesting brunch centerpiece that was also gluten free. Hurray for mochiko! Unfortunately I didn't capture any evidence of these waffles, because they were delicious and we were hungry. They had a very pleasant chew that regular waffles don't have, and a subtle flavor that I almost preferred to eat alone or only with butter. Cleaning the waffle maker after cooking them was a struggle - the batter set like cement on the outsides, and I found myself scraping it off with a butter knife!

Several weeks later, I re-discovered in my cabinet this package of taro mochi puffs - by which the manufacturer might have actually meant taro this time; as described in [this post](https://www.honestfoodtalks.com/ube-vs-taro-difference/), they're usually confused. This is only exacerbated by the popular "taro boba" incorporating the less-sweet qualities of taro and the bright purple of ube!

Either way, these puffs were delightful. The batter was thick, and I'm sure if I didn't have a belgian waffle maker they would have spread out more. As they were, each one was only two bites of waffle, with the characteristic chew of mochiko.
