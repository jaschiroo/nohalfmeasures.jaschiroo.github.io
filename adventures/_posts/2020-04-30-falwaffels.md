Sometime near the end of 2019 I tried to make baked falafel, and it didn't go well. I used chickpeas from a can instead of dried, and I added way too much chickpea liquid. Of course this was when I'd invited a (thankfully very patient) guest over for dinner, and instead of creating beautiful falafel on the first go, we ended up creating a falafel stir-fry of sorts.

Determined to try again, I looked for recipes that used canned chickpeas instead of dried, because if I'm honest dried chickpeas sounds like way too much work.

I did find one, but instead of baking them on a sheet, I had the brilliant idea to use a waffle maker. Sounds amazing, right? You can use a specialized piece of equipment to pseudo-fry and cook waffles made of falafel batter! Thus, falwaffels.

I used [this recipe](https://www.eatingbirdfood.com/easy-baked-falafel/), with the exception that I don't always have parsley (it'll be fine, I promise!) and instead of oat flour I used gram (chickpea) flour so as to maintain the flavor.

The secret is to use lots - and I mean _lots_ of oil on the waffle maker. This is our old waffle maker, and the non-stick surface was a little worn out, so it already needed special care. Falwaffels need to cook much longer than their typical waffle counterparts, but through trial and error we pretty much figured it out.
