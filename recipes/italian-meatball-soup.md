Italian Meatball Soup

This is a recipe that I discovered a long time ago, and I make it over and over again. I've also heard it called "Wedding Soup". The original recipe was on a blog that no longer exists, so I'm sharing my modified version.

Ingredients
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 pound italian sausage
- 1 large onion, sliced
- salt, as desired
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 4 cups chicken broth
- 28 oz diced tomatoes
- 1 teaspoon dried basil (or 2 teaspoons chopped fresh)
- 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
- 2 large handfuls spinach
- 2 9-oz packages tortellini (I usually buy frozen)
- parmesan cheese (optional)

Directions
1. Form the sausage into small meatballs. In a large pan cook until done, turning frequently. Remove from pan and let drain.
2. In the same pan, add the olive oil and onions, then a pinch of salt. Saute until tender, and then add the garlic.
3. Raise heat and add the chicken broth, diced tomatoes, and herbs. Bring to a simmer.
4. Add the tortellini and meatballs, and simmer for 15 minutes.
5. Add the spinach and stir until wilted. Stir in parmesan, if desired, and a little more broth if the consistency is too thick.
