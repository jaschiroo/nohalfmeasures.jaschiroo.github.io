Red Wing Jambalaya

This recipe was given to me by a woman from a church in Red Wing, MN. The original recipe made a huge amount of food, so here is a version that makes 6-8 servings.

Ingredients
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 onion, sliced
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 stalks celery, chopped
- 14.5 oz diced tomatoes
- 1 box Uncle Ben's Wild Rice (Quick Cooking)
- 1 cup white rice, uncooked
- 1/2 link kielbasa or Andouille sausage, sliced
- 1/2 lb. pork sausage
- 2 cups chicken broth, or as needed
- optional: 1 chicken breast, cubed or 2 chicken thighs, cubed

Directions
1. Preheat the oven to 350Â°F.
2. In a Dutch oven, heat the olive oil. If you don't have a dutch oven, use a regular pan and then transfer to a baking dish to put in the oven.
3. Cook the onions until tender, add garlic, and saute for a few more minutes. Add the celery.
4. Turn off the heat. Mix all ingredients except broth together, crumbling the sausage. If not using a dutch oven, mix ingredients in a bowl and then transfer to a baking dish.
5. Add enough broth to almost cover the mixture.
6. Cover with foil or the lid of the Dutch oven.
7. Bake covered for 1 hour, then uncovered for 30 minutes. Stir after 1 hour.
