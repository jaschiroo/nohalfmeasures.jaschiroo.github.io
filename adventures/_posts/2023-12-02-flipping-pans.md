We got an induction range (hurray!) Some of our favorite frying pans aren't induction-compatible, however, which kicked off the Great Search for the Best Flipping Induction Frying Pan. Specifically, an indution pan that is actually pleasant to flip with: for crepes, naan, omelettes, etc. 

The main aspects of a pan that appear to matter here are weight and curvature. Weight is already going to be a balancing act because induction pans need to have some amount of ferrous metal, the more the better, which is going to directly impact the amount of wrist strength you need to flip something in the pan. For curvature, the angle where the wall of the pan meets the base can stop your naan from beginning it's flip as you move it towards the edge of the pan and into the air, while too much curve might mean that it's difficult to get the finished naan out of the pan.

I tried to find an assortment of potential pans to try out. Another desired attriibute is some sort of non-stick. I have a slight preference towards ceramic non-stick, but I'm willing to try other options as well. This is mostly driven by the fact that I haven't historically been good at cooking on low heat and I have been known to burn food to the bottom of the pan, and mabye a little non-stick magic can at least help with the latter.

I made a point of dragging my SO out to a physical store at the actual mall to flip some pans in real life. We were considering several pans from All-Clad, Scanpan, GreenPan, and Zwilling. Of these, primarly the average retail price of $100+ is the kicker - if I'm not sure that this pan will work for me after waving it around in the air while the sales associate hovers nearby awkwardly, do I want to buy it and then risk dealing with whatever returns process they have? Not yet. I do think that the Zwilling stood the best chance of being a nice flipping pan out of that set, and I still want to go flip some pans at the local Cooks \| Bellecour.

Of the pans that I did purchase, I'm most worried about the Misen stainless steel. I am not known for cooking delicately, or patience, and it seems like stainless steel requires that and a decent amount of skill. In order to give it a fair shake, I have been reading tips on cooking with stainless steel. We also bought an 8" Figmint nonstick ceramic, but it was too small or the ferrous metal content wasn't high enough for it to register on even the smallest burner, which is supposed to accept a 4.5" minimum diameter pan. We'll get to test this theory with the KitchenAid, although for comparison to the rest of the pans it would have been better to have another 10" version.
