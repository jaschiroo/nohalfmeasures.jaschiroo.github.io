In 2019 I visited Ashama grocery for the first time. I discovered some of the spices I needed to make Ethipian food, and at the back of the store to my delight I found bags of onions! As is my nature, I bought one.

Upon bringing it home, I realized I had little idea how to store 50 lbs of onions so that I would actually be able to *use* most of them. Cue frantic Googling. As it turns out, onions like to be stored in a cool, dry place with lots of air circulation. After an extended search I found nylons on an endcap at Target and off we went!

It's important to sort through the onions, pulling out any that are soft - that first round I learned they will mold and slowly infect the onions around them. They can be used if you're quick! From 50 lbs of onions I got about 67 into longer-term storage, and it was fantastic! Onions whenever I need!
