I happened to get offered a 4lb box of blueberries, and who could say no to that? I rode home happily snacking, and then had to decide what to do with slightly less than 4lbs of blueberries.

The first thing I did was make blueberry jam, thinking that this is the most versatile thing that I could use to make many other things from, and would prevent the blueberries from going bad before I had a chance to use them.

I followed the recipe in my Ball Blue Book of Canning.

That got me 17 half-pint jars and 1 pint jar of jam to either eat or use in other projects!

The next day, I went to a friend's and we had a blueberry party! We started with two loaves of blueberry bread.

And we also made blueberry crumble!

The rest of the jam will probably be eaten straight, although there could be more adventures in it's future.
