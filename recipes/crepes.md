Liz's Crepes

This is a recipe given to me by a friend and which used to be up on her blog, which is unfortunately no longer available. It's too good not to share though!

Ingredients
- 1 c flour
- 1 tsp sugar
- 1/4 tsp salt
- 3 eggs
- 1 1/2 c milk
- 2 Tbsp butter, melted


Directions
1. Mix the flour, sugar and salt in a bowl. Mix the eggs and milk together.
2. Pour half of the milk mixture into the dry ingredients and whisk until combined.
3. Mix in the melted butter and whisk until combined.
4. Pour in the rest of the milk mixture and whisk until smooth.
5. Heat a heavy, flat-bottomed pan on medium heat.
6. Coat the pan with butter, and pour in slightly less than ¼ c of the batter into the pan, swirling to create a thin, even coat.
7. Cook until the edges are beginning to brown, and then flip. Cook for a few seconds more before sliding onto a plate.

Thoughts
- You may need to turn the heat down if your crepes are turning out dark or cooking really quickly
- The first side of the crepe will be done when you can shake it loose or lift it easily. If it doesn't come up, let it cook for a few more seconds.
- The first crepe will always come out more misshapen than the others - this is normal.

This recipe should make approximately 12 crepes. Serve with sliced strawberries and whipped cream, lemon juice and powdered sugar (my favorite), berries and yogurt, nutella, or onions and crumbled sausage...anything you can think of!
