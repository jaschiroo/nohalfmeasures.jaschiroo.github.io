At the farmers market one day, I saw a purple cauliflower. I ignored the thought for a bit, and then walked back through the entire market to collect all the purple veggies I could find in order to make a purple veggie roast.

To roast with the cauliflower, I found carrots, sweet potatoes, and a purple bell pepper, and threw in a red onion and some brats that I had. As I expected, they were just so beautiful.

Only the bell pepper was disappointing - it turns out that they are still white inside!

The sausage took on a purple hue from all of the veggies. I got a kick out of it, and I think I earned a groan from my SO.
