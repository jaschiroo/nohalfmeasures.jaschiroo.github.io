Before the world shut down in 2020, a coworker took us to Hmong Village. What a place! It's everything a Hmong person needs to live comfortably in Minnesota - from groceries, clothing, barber, shoe shop, tax preparer - they've got it all. Plus, a massive food court where you can get a ridiculous variety of Hmong food. I was in heaven. We tried at least ten different items, coming away stuffed and not at all close to finishing it all. There were a few foods I took away immediately as a "must learn", including banana cakes.

Fast forward to late in the year, and I was at the Asian grocery store and saw a package helpfully labeled "Extra Tasty Hmong Sausage". Who could resist?

Thus I was inspired to make only Hmong food for our New Year's Eve dinner. I immediately begged my SO to ask his coworker what I could make to go with my Extra Tasty Hmong Sausage, and he suggested wilted greens and pepper sauce, and of course we had to have banana cakes! Plus I wanted to try out purple rice in the banana cakes. I just fried up the sausage, made the banana cakes and sides and there we were!
