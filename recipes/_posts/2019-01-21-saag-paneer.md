Justina's Saag Paneer

This is a recipe tweaked from many other saag paneer recipes, taking bits that I loved and leaving difficult steps out. I think this one has the smoothest, most flavorful sauce.

Ingredients
- 4 bunches spinach
- Olive oil or butter
- 1 large onion
- 1 tsp ginger or Â¼ tsp ground ginger
- Optional: 1-2 green chilies
- 1 tsp tumeric
- 1 tsp cumin
- 1/2 tsp chili powder
- 1 tsp coriander
- 1 tsp garam masala
- 1 tsp salt or to taste
- 14 oz. can diced tomatoes
- 1/2 c water or broth
- 1/2 c whipping cream or half & half
- 500 g paneer, cut into small cubes

Directions
1. Wash and sort spinach. Cut/tear into short lengths to prevent stringy bits.
2. Add a little oil to the pan. Wilt spinach (multiple batches if necessary) until tender.
3. Blend spinach to a smooth paste. Set aside.
4. Chop onion. Add oil if necessary and cook onion until translucent. Add fresh ginger and chilies, if using.
5. Add all spices and cook for a minute, until thoroughly combined with onion and oil.
6. Add tomatoes and broth. Stir well.
7. Add spinach paste to the pan and stir until completely mixed. You can delay at this point if necessary. Taste and add salt or more spices if desired.
8. Right before serving, heat until bubbly if you delayed then add the cream and stir well.
9. Add the paneer and stir gently, being careful not to break up the paneer. Serve!

Thoughts
- Timing: 2 hrs before dinner, start naan dough rising. 1 hr before dinner start sorting and wilting spinach. 30 min before dinner start rice. Get to step 7, cook naan, then finish the saag paneer and serve.
- You can blend the tomatoes with the spinach for a smoother sauce.
