While making the lemon muffins, I ran into a problem - one of the eggs in the carton was cracked, leaving me with two eggs when I needed three.

Luckily, one of the experiments we tried with the freeze drier was eggs! Reconstituting them is simply mixing 2 Tbsp egg powder with 2 Tbsp water and whisking vigorously.

    </a>
  </div>

This also gave a convenient chance to compare how the freeze dried egg compares to a fresh egg, and whether you can tell the diffeence in a finished baked product. Mixing was no issue, some of the larger chunks took a bit longer to soak up the water and become liquid.

    </a>
  </div>

It appears that the ratios produce a bit less total volume than a fresh egg, and the color is slightly different - the reconstituted egg is on the left, with the fork.

      <img src="/assets/eggs/comparison.jpg" alt="comparison of reconstituted and fresh egg" style="width:100%">
    </a>
  </div>

  <div class="img-container">
    <a target="blank" href="/assets/eggs/volume.jpg">
      <img src="/assets/eggs/volume.jpg" alt="volume comparison" style="width:100%">
    </a>
  </div>

As expected, it wasn't likely that anyone could tell that one of the three eggs was freeze dried. I'll have to try using only freeze dried eggs for a recipe in the future!
