Ingredients
- 1/2 c butter
- 1 1/2 c sugar
- 2 eggs
- 1/4 c milk
- 1 tsp vinegar
- 1 tsp vanilla
- 2 c flour
- 1/4 tsp baking powder
- 3/4 tsp baking soda
- 1 tsp salt
- 3 mashed bananas

Directions
1. Preheat the oven to 350°F
2. Cream the butter and sugar
3. Add the eggs, milk, vinegar and vanilla
4. Combine the dry ingredients
5. Mix the dry ingredients into the wet mixture until just combined
6. Mix in the mashed bananas
7. Divide into two well-greased loaf pans
8. Bake for 45 minutes, then lower the temperature to 300°F and test with a toothpick every 10 minutes until no crumbs are stuck to the toothpick when you pull it out
9. Let cool completely

**To make this vegan**
- use your favorite plant-based butter
- use 1/4 applesauce in place of the eggs. It will be a softer bread.
- use alternative milk. I'm not sure if you can omit the vinegar if you do.

**To add more fiber**
- Add 1/4 cup of ground flax seed and 1/4 cup of chia seeds
- use whole wheat flour instead of all purpose flour
