They don't sell Peanut Butter Twix anymore. They came back briefly in 2017, but were discontinued again sometime around 2020. Because they're delicious, I've tried making them a couple of different times with varying levels of success. There are, of course, many recipes out there imitating Twix, so why not add one more?

Here's the recipe I've worked out so far:

Shortbread base:
- 250g butter, softened
- 110g sugar
- 360g flour

Instructions:
1. Beat together butter and sugar umtil well combined and creamy.
2. Stir in flour.
3. Chill while you preheat the oven to 375Â°F.
4. Press into a 9x13" pan, lined with foil or parchment paper.
5. Bake 15-20 min until the edges are just barely browning.

Peanut Butter filling:
- 2 c peanut butter (512g)
- 1 package graham crackers, finely crushed
- 1/2 c powdered sugar

Instructions:
1. Beat all ingredients together, warm the peanut butter if it isn't mixing well.

Chocolate topping:
- 500g chocolate almond bark
- 4 Tbsp vegetable shortening (48g)

Instructions:
1. Melt together in short bursts in a microwave or in a double boiler, stirring frequently

Option 1

Once you've gotten the shortbread base baked, let it cool. Then spread the peanut butter filling over the shortbread with a spatula. I chilled it at this point to help it set.

I have tried putting the chocolate directly on top of the peanut butter mixture, and that works fine but if the chocolate is very stiff (not enough shortening) then when you cut it into bars it squishes the peanut butter filling out.

Option 2

Alternatively, you can cut the shortbread into rectangles, dip the bottoms into the chocolate, and pipe the peanut butter filling on top. Then, set a wire rack over a bowl and slowly spoon the chocolate over the peanut butter and cookie, tapping the rack to get extra chocolate off.

This honestly produces the most satisfying Twix imitations, bcause the chocolate is in the right proportion to the cookie and peanut butter. It does take significantly longer!
