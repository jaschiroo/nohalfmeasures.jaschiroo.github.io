There's something comforting about wild rice soup, and my favorite version is of course a [crock pot recipe](https://damndelicious.net/2016/12/09/slow-cooker-chicken-wild-rice-soup/) that is low-effort and delicious. I've made this recipe many times and it's always delicious, but this is not about those times.

This is about the time I made it purple.

It turns out, for my [Hmong New Year's dinner](https://nohalfmeasures.jschiroo.com/adventures/2020/12/31/hmong-new-years.html) I had bought purple rice to mix with the glutinous rice to make purple sticky rice (which was fantastic, by the way). But in the cupboard, purple rice looks basically the same as wild rice, which is what this recipe calls for.

The flavor wasn't actually different, just the lavender purple color. I thought it was hilarious, and my SO did eat some of it. The real end of this dish was when we got ready to eat it as leftovers and the purple had faded to a vaguely-purple gray. I think I ate one bowl before I called it a loss.
