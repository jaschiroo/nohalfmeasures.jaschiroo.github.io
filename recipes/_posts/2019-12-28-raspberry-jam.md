_Based on both [this epicurious recipe](https://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/old-fashioned-raspberry-jam-230700) and [this NCHFP recipe](https://nchfp.uga.edu/how/can_07/berry_jams.html)._

Ingredients
- 9 cups crushed berries
- 6 cups sugar

Instructions
1. Sterilize canning jars in by boiling for 5 minutes. Heat lids and rings.
2. Warm the sugar in the oven at 250°F for 15 minutes.
3. Wash berries if fresh. Begin heating over medium heat while stirring and crushing.
4. Add sugar and stir constantly until the sugar dissolves.
5. Once sugar is dissolved, cook rapidly to, or almost to, the jellying point of approximately 220°F, depending upon whether a firm or soft jam is desired. As mixture thickens, stir frequently to prevent sticking. 
6. Remove from heat and fill hot jam into hot, sterile jars, leaving ¼-inch headspace.
7. Wipe rims of jars with a dampened clean paper towel; adjust two-piece metal canning lids.
8. Process in a Boiling Water Canner for 5 minutes.
