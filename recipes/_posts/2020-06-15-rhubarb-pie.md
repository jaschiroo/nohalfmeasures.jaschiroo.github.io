Ingredients

9" two-crust pie
- 2 cups flour
- 1 tsp salt
- 2/3 cups plus 2 Tbsp vegetable shortening
- 1/4 cup water (possibly more)

Filling
- 4 cups fresh rhubarb, washed and sliced into chunks or 8 cups frozen rhubarb pieces
- 1 cup sugar
- 1/3 cup flour
- 1/4 cup granulated tapioca (Minute Tapioca)

Directions

Filling
1. Mix all ingredients
2. Add a little water if the dry ingredients are settling to the bottom of the bowl

Crust
1. Mix salt and flour in a bowl
2. Cut in the shortening with a fork or pastry blender until only small pieces remain
3. Sprinkle with water and mix with a fork until a loose dough forms. Avoid making the dough sticky
4. Gather the dough into a ball with your hands, incorporating any small remaining pieces
5. Divide the dough in half and roll out on a lightly floured surface until it's larger than the pie tin
6. Fold in quarters and/or use a pastry scraper to get it off the surface
7. Lay the crust gently on the pie tin and spread it out
9. Cut overhanging edges off
10. Fill with filling
11. Repeat rolling out the top pie crust and placing it on top of the filling, trim the edges
12. Roll the edges inward and pinch together
13. Prick the top of the pie several times with a fork
14. Bake at 425Â°F for 50 minutes. If using pie-edge-protectors or foil, remove them after 40 minutes. Place a pan underneath the pie tin to catch any juice.
15. Serve warm or chilled. The pie will set as it cools.
