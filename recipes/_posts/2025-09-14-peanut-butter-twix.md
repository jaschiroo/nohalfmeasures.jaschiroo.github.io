These are as close as I've gotten to the discontinued Twix PB bars.

**Ingredients**

Shortbread
- 450g butter, softened
- 1 tsp salt, if your butter is unsalted
- 680g flour
- 200g sugar

Peanut Butter Filling
- 512g peanut butter
- 1 package graham crackers
- 1/2 c powdered sugar

Chocolate coating
- 2 packages (1360g) chocolate almond bark
- 2 Tbsp vegetable shortening

**Directions**

Shortbread
- Heat the oven to 375Â°F.
- Mix butter and sugar until just combined, don't cream.
- Mix in flour, and salt if using, until the dough just comes together into lumps.
- Press into a 9x13" pan lined with parchment paper and dock to prevent air bubbles.
- Bake for 20 minutes or until very lightly golden brown.

Peanut Butter Filling
- Finely crush graham crackers
- Mix all ingredientsly thoroughly
- Allow the shortbread base to cool slightly, but not completely. Spread the peanut butter filling evenly over the top with an offset spatula.
- Cut into 3" x 3/4" fingers, or desired size
- Chill until the peanut butter filling is solidified

Chocolate Coating
- Melt chocolate and vegetable shortening together in a glass container in the microwave, starting with 30 second bursts and stirring. I like to use a loaf pan because it is the same rectangular shape as my bars and it is deep but not wide. I like to melt it in two batches so it doesn't harden as I work. If it does harden, simply melt again.
- Dip the bottom and halfway (or more) up the sides of the fingers into the chocolate and shake off the extra.
- Chill fingers again.
- Roll the other three sides of the PB fingers in the chocolate, shaking off the extra.

The chocolate should harden on its own, but you can always put it back in the freezer to chill. I store these in the freezer and I'd say you could store them for several months, if they last that long!
