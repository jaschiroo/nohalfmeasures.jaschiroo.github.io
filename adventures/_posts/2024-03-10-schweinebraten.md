Around the holidays we went to the European Christmas Market several times, something I had never done before. Besides having hot cider, pancake balls and doing a little shopping, the highlight was stopping at a place that sold German Christmas roast, or schweinebraten. It was heavenly - rich gravy, tender meat, and we got a potato dish to mop up the remaining gravy.

So what is there to do except try and make it myself? I followed this recipe for [schweinebraten](https://www.food.com/recipe/authentic-schweinebraten-german-pork-roast-bavarian-style-446331) - almost exactly for once, except using pork loin so that I could make cubanos later that week. It took 2.5 hours to make all told, but braising the meat gave it such a delicious flavor.

I would say that the end result was good, but not as amazing as the dish at the Market. I think having the meat in slices rather than more of a stew-like texture meant that the gravy and meat weren't as well mixed, so each bite had less flavor. The cubanos were amazing, so I guess we'll just have to try schweinebraten again!
