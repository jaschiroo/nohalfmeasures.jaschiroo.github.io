This is my in-progress attempt to emulate peanut butter Twix/Twix PB.

Shortbread base:
- 250g butter, softened
- 110g sugar
- 360g flour

Peanut Butter filling:
- 2 c peanut butter (512g)
- 1 package graham crackers, finely crushed
- 1/2 c powdered sugar

Chocolate topping:
- 500g chocolate almond bark
- 4 Tbsp vegetable shortening (48g)

Instructions:
1. Beat together butter and sugar umtil well combined and creamy.
2. Stir in flour.
3. Chill while you preheat the oven to 375Â°F.
4. Press into a 9x13" pan, lined with foil or parchment paper.
5. Bake 15-20 min until the edges are just barely browning.
6. Let cool completely while you make the peanut butter filling.
1. Beat all peanut butter filling ingredients together, warm the peanut butter if it isn't mixing well.
1. Melt together in short bursts in a microwave or in a double boiler, stirring frequently

Option 1:
9. Spread the peanut butter filling over the shortbread with a spatula.
10. Chill to help it set.
11. Pour the chocolate on top of the peanut butter mixture, spreading with a spatula if needed.
12. Chill until the chocolate has set.
13. Cut into bars, being careful not to squish the filling out.

Option 2:
9. Cut the shortbread into rectangles
10. Dip the bottoms into the chocolate
11. Pipe the peanut butter filling on top of the shortbread
12. Set a wire rack over a bowl and slowly spoon the chocolate over the peanut butter and cookie, tapping the rack to get extra chocolate off.

Option 2 takes much longer, but it produces cookies that are much more like the original peanut butter Twix!
