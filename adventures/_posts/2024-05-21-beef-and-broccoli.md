I found an interesting variation on beef and broccoli! After a family cookout, we ended up with an entire container of leftover, grilled hamburgers. A few of these were fried up and added to homemade ramen, which still left 8 or so to use.

I'll start with the hamburger recipe - it's a little like meatloaf, which makes it quite tender. 

- 2 lbs (900 g) hamburger
- 3 tsp (15 ml) seasoning
- 2 eggs
- 2 c (500 ml) fine breadcrumbs

Mix everything together and grill! Then, if you're me, bring them home in a container and leave them in the fridge, wondering what you'll do with them every time you open the door.

Thus, beef and broccoli!

I used this [sauce recipe](https://www.kitchensanctuary.com/beef-and-broccoli/#wprm-recipe-container-26818) for the most part, although I just used one kind of soy sauce, no brown sugar and only one kind of pepper. Chop some broccoli, stir fry everything and tada!

It was surprisingly good! The hamburgers are much more tender than any flank steak I've cooked for this recipe, and because they're already cooked you're only looking to warm them and let some maillard reaction happen. I'll bet we use up leftover hamburgers like this in the future, or even leftover meatloaf!
