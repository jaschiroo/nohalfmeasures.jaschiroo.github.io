_Scaled from [this recipe](https://foodinjars.com/recipe/meyer-lemon-curd/) with reference to [this NCHFP recipe](https://nchfp.uga.edu/how/can_02/lemon_curd.html)._

Ingredients
- 30 egg yolks
- 5 cup sugar
- 15 meyer lemons
- 5 stick of butter, cut into chunks

Instructions
1. Zest all the lemons. You should get anywhere from 1/3 to 1/2 cup of zest.
2. Juice all the lemons. Roll the lemon under your palm to soften it, then cut in half and juice. Straining out the big pieces of pulp and seeds now will save you a little time later. You should get more than 4 cups of juice from your 15 lemons.
3. Separate your egg yolks. You can save and freeze the whites in ice cube trays.
4. In a pot over medium heat, mix together the egg yolks and sugar first.
5. Add the lemon juice and zest and mix gently.
6. Stir gently but continuously for 10-15 minutes, adjusting the heat as you go to ensure that it does not boil.
7. Your curd is done when it has thickened and coats the back of the spoon.
8. When you determine that it's finished, drop in the butter and stir until melted.
9. Strain your curd through a mesh sieve to remove any bits of cooked egg and the zest.
10. Pour the curd into prepared jars, leaving 1/2 inch of headspace.
11. Freeze for up to a year or process them in a boiling water canner for 20 minutes (start the time when the water returns to a boil).
