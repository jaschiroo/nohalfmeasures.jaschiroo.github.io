  <p>Hello, my name is Justina! Thanks for visiting.</p>
  <img src="/assets/self.jpg">
  <p>Professionally Iâ€™m somewhere between a technical business analyst and a product owner/manager, but as a hobby I like to take on projects in cooking and preserving that are bigger than I expected. I rarely follow just one recipe and I'm always modifying things and forgetting to write them down, so I started this as a way to keep track of my adventures, successes and flops alike. Hopefully it's a little bit funny but also realistic - not every recipe works out the first time, the second time...or the seventh. Enjoy!</p>
