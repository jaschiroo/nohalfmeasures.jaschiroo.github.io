I had wanted to make challah for a long time, dreaming of the soft, layered dough right along side hokkaido milk bread. Finally I got the chance, as I now have a friend with a family recipe who had made them before!

<div class="clearfix">
  <div class="img-container">
    <a target="blank" href="/assets/challah/raw.jpg">
      <img src="/assets/challah/raw.jpg" alt="challah ready for second proofing" style="width:100%">
    </a>
  </div>
</div>

Challah is _involved_. You've got the mixing, the first rise, the second rise, the shaping, the proofing and the baking. But what you get out of this multi-hour process is a beautiful, fluffy bread that also makes _amazing_ french toast.

  <div class="img-container">

      <img src="/assets/challah/baked.jpg" alt="Baked challah" style="width:100%">
    </a>
  </div>
</div>

Not that this loaf survived that long!
