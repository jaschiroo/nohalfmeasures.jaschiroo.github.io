We've been having dutch babies (or dutch pancakes, if you prefer) from [this trusty recipe](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/6648-dutch-baby) for a long time. It's quick, easy and tasty. I do mix it in a small blender, and I bake it in my 10" cast iron skillet in the oven. I find It's more successful if you warm the eggs in hot water and microwave the milk a bit. It also works if you use oat milk instead of whole milk.

One day a friend mentioned that she put savory toppings on her dutch baby, and it blew my mind. We usually top with a variety of breakfast condiments: lemon curd, peanut butter, honey, or yogurt butter.

To make it savory, I put in garlic powder instead of the nutmeg, and omitted the sugar.

I topped it with a vaguely Mediterranean assortment of sun-dried tomatoes, kalmata olives, pancetta, artichoke hearts, basil and mozzarella. It's amazing. You can put anything you want on it, and the crispy, tender base of the dutch baby will complement it all. Besides the endless variety, it really only takes the time to preheat and bake to have this delightful mashup ready to eat.
